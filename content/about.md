## Who's Rob
I bet you're able to figure this out through my LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter account. But in short, I'm a Dutch software developer. Mainly focused on Java platforms. Over the last year I'm more and more involved in Javascript frameworks too. Especially Angularjs has my attention. For all other interest, see the social media.
